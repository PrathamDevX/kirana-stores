IMPORTANT: Before implementing the main functionality, update these critical files:

1. Home View (lib/features/home_view.dart):
- Remove ALL template demonstration components
- Create a clean slate for the implementation based on the main request

2. Startup View (lib/features/startup/startup_view.dart & startup_viewmodel.dart):
- Remove template splash screen
- Ensure proper navigation to the main screen

Main Request:
Design a complete mobile app UI for an application named **ApniDukaan**.  
This app is for **local kirana shopkeepers** to manage their products, accept orders, and update stock easily.  
Create clean, minimal, modern UI screens with a warm friendly theme using colors:  
- Primary: #FF9933 (Indian orange – friendly, local vibe)  
- Secondary: #2E7D32 (Green – trust & freshness)  
- Background: Light neutral (#F9F9F9)  
- Text: Dark grey/black

Use rounded cards, simple icons, and a modern Indian-small-business feel.  
Design the UI following **Material You** / modern flat UI principles.

## 📌 Deliverables
Generate the complete UI flow for all screens above in a consistent design system.  
Make sure colors, typography, iconography, spacing, and layout remain consistent across the entire app.  


Note: The final implementation should look completely different from the template app.

And since this is first prompts always use in memory variable INSTEAD OF USING DATABASE or FIRESTORE.
